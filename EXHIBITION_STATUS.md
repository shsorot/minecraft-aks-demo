## 🚀 Ready-to-Use Commands

### Quick Deployment (New Exhibition)
```powershell
# Deploy fresh environment
.\scripts\quick-deploy.ps1 -Prefix "demo02"
# Result: rg-demo02-minecraft-aks-demo with consistent IP
```

### Demonstrate IP Consistency (Current Environment)
```powershell
# Test with current deployment
.\scripts\test-ip-consistency.ps1
# Simulates 3 pod failures, verifies IP remains 40.127.222.166
```

### Manual Pod Restart Demo
```powershell
# Show current state
kubectl get pods -l app=minecraft-server -o wide

# Simulate failure
kubectl delete pod -l app=minecraft-server

# Verify IP consistency
kubectl get service minecraft-service -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
# Should still return: 40.127.222.166
```

### Complete Cleanup
```powershell
# Current environment
az group delete --name rg-demo01-minecraft-aks-demo --yes --no-wait

# List all demo environments
az group list --query "[?contains(name, 'minecraft-aks-demo')].name" --output table
```

## 🎭 Exhibition Script Highlights

### Phase 1: Baseline (2 minutes)
- Show running server at `40.127.222.166:25565`
- Display current pod name
- Test connectivity

### Phase 2: Failure Simulation (3 minutes)
- Delete pod with `kubectl delete pod -l app=minecraft-server`
- Show Kubernetes creating new pod
- Verify IP remains `40.127.222.166`

### Phase 3: Verification (2 minutes)
- Test connectivity to same IP
- Show different pod name (proving replacement)
- Demonstrate data persistence

### Phase 4: Advanced Demo (3 minutes)
- Run automated test script
- Show multiple failures with consistent IP
- Display enterprise monitoring capabilities

## 🔒 IP Consistency Guarantees

### Technical Implementation
- **Azure LoadBalancer**: Provides static public IP reservation
- **Kubernetes Service**: Routes traffic to healthy pods regardless of pod changes
- **Session Affinity**: Maintains player connections when possible
- **Health Probes**: Automatic traffic routing to healthy instances only

### Tested Scenarios ✅
- ✅ **Pod Deletion**: IP remains consistent
- ✅ **Pod Restart**: IP remains consistent
- ✅ **Node Failure**: IP remains consistent (pod rescheduled)
- ✅ **Multiple Failures**: IP remains consistent across all scenarios
- ✅ **Scaling Events**: IP remains consistent during scale up/down

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Deployment Performance
- **Full Deployment**: 15-20 minutes (AKS cluster creation)
- **Pod Restart**: 30-60 seconds (container startup)
- **IP Assignment**: Immediate (pre-existing LoadBalancer)
- **Data Recovery**: Instant (persistent storage)

### Resource Efficiency
- **VM Size**: Standard_D2s_v3 (optimized cost/performance)
- **Auto-scaling**: 1-5 nodes based on demand
- **Storage**: 100GB Premium_LRS (high performance)
- **Region**: North Europe (optimal for demonstrations)

## 🎮 Player Experience

### Connection Details
- **Server Address**: `40.127.222.166:25565`
- **Max Players**: 16 concurrent
- **Game Mode**: Survival
- **World Persistence**: ✅ Guaranteed across pod restarts
- **Session Continuity**: Brief disconnection during pod restart (30-60s)

### What Players Experience During Pod Restart
1. **Connection Drop**: ~30 seconds during pod replacement
2. **Reconnection**: Same IP address, same world
3. **Progress Preserved**: All building/progress intact
4. **Performance**: No degradation after restart

## 🏆 Exhibition Success Factors

### Pre-Demo Preparation
- ✅ **Test Deployment**: Verify in target region beforehand
- ✅ **Backup Plan**: Have cleanup commands ready
- ✅ **Network Requirements**: Ensure external connectivity for audience
- ✅ **Demo Timing**: Allow 10-15 minutes for complete demonstration

### Audience Engagement
- ✅ **Interactive Elements**: Let audience connect to server
- ✅ **Visual Impact**: Show pod deletion/recreation in real-time
- ✅ **Business Value**: Emphasize cost savings and reliability
- ✅ **Technical Depth**: Adjust complexity based on audience

### Common Questions & Answers
- **Q**: "What happens to connected players?"
- **A**: "Brief disconnection (~30s), then reconnect to same IP with progress preserved"

- **Q**: "How much does this cost?"
- **A**: "~$200-300/month for production use, scales down to save costs when idle"

- **Q**: "Can this handle enterprise workloads?"
- **A**: "Yes, this demonstrates patterns used by major gaming companies"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### If External IP Takes Too Long
```powershell
kubectl describe service minecraft-service
# Check LoadBalancer provisioning status
```

### If Pod Won't Start
```powershell
kubectl describe pod -l app=minecraft-server
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
# Check for resource constraints or image pull issues
```

### If Storage Issues
```powershell
kubectl describe pvc minecraft-pvc
# Verify Azure Files permissions and availability
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ **IP Consistency**: External IP never changes across pod failures
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: World data survives all restart scenarios
- ✅ **Exhibition Ready**: One-command deployment with clear demonstration path
- ✅ **Professional Presentation**: Clean documentation and organized repository
- ✅ **Enterprise Patterns**: LoadBalancer, auto-scaling, persistent storage, monitoring
- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource usage with auto-scaling
- ✅ **Easy Cleanup**: Simple resource group deletion removes everything
